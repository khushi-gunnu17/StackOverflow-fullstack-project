## What is a MERN Stack ?
- Full stack technology refers to the entire depth of a computer system application, and full stack developers straddle two separate web development domains: the frontend and the backend. Front end developers work to optimize the visible parts of an application for web browsers and mobile devices.
- MERN stack stands for ReactJS, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDb
- Express and node make up the middle (application) tier. ExpressJs is a server-side web framework, and Node.js is the popular and powerful Javascript server platform. MERN is the ideal approach to working with Javascript and JSON, all the way through.

Client-Server Model

client -- Request --> server
client <-- Response -- server


### HTTP
- HyperText Transfer Protocol
- Messages are formatted based on this protocol.
- Ex : https://www.facebook.com
- It is an application layer using which you can share hypermedia such as HTML.
- It is designed to establish a communication between client and the server.


### DOM
